String.
	String is Immutable Object.which means each time when we create String Object it will create new Object each time.
	Two ways to Create String Object.
	1. String s = "abc";
	2. String s1 = new String("abc");
		
		--> the first way is use a String pool.means it will first find the String "abc" in String pool memory.
			if this String "abc" is available in String pool than it will return the reference of that String.
			otherwise it will make a entry or we can say create object in String pool and return reference of memory.
			
		--> the second way it will create new Object in Heap Memory. it will create new Object of String in heap memory.
			like normal Object Creation in Heap Memory.
			
			
What do you mean by Immutable.
	Immutable means Object does not change once it will Created.
	any modification into Objects will result in  Creation of new Object.			

Why String is Immutable in Java
	Suppose that 
	String a = "abc";
	String b = a;
	b = b+"avdfdf";
	than any changes into String b will also reflect to String a. 
	so String we will use for multiple reason like password etc.
	so for security reason java designer make this String Object Immutable.
